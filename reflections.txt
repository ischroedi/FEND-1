  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

1. I've learned the skill, to research at the web for the markup to display that like in the MOCKUP
2. That was okay and easy, but it took some time to research the right html5 tag 
3. After a few years of coding html5 were the new figure and figcaption new and sometimes difficult to use, the img tag always cames around :-o
4. the solving strategie was like these
-- looking at the mockup
-- building the first elements like h1-h4
-- building the paragraph
-- building the fonts linke strong and em
-- creating the image links 
-- creating the links
-- creating the other tags like sup and s 
-- checking the "big" picture
!!! Working linke the DOMTREE works in this projects fine :D
